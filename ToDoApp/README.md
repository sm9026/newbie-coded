# ToDoApp
<p>This is program that will store tasks or your ThingsToDo.</p>
<p>Every task has a name, description, and a priority level, all of which should be given by the user.</p>
<p>User can add, delete, view tasks, mark tasks as Done/NotDone and sort tasks</p>
<p>It is a completed project (although half-heartedly). Could be improved along with introduction of more features(especially an undo feature where you can retrieve a deleted task or mark a task undone which was previously marked as done and also a feature which can find tasks by searching for keywords or sort tasks alphabetically)</p>
<p>A lot can be done with this simple program but for now I am leaving it at that.</p>
